Home_LAN_Splash
===============

A home network splash page with a persistent chalkboard.

My first GIT project. This is a home network splash page. It holds links to the webUIs for all of the network attached devices and services.
It also has space to embed the family calendar using Google Calendar or similar. Finally, it has a persistent chalkboard to leave notes on.
This project uses a php script to write text to the server. For that reason I don't recommend using this on a public-facing server. It is intended for use on the LAN.
